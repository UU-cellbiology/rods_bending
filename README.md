thin rods bending
============

This package is able to calculate the shape of thin bent rod under load.

It can handle large loads and nonlinear deformations of rod.

It was developed to describe the shape of microtubules bending
under the force of kinesins in this paper:   
Doodhi H, Katrukha EA, Kapitein LC, Akhmanova A. [Mechanical and geometrical constraints control kinesin-based microtubule guidance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24462000) Curr Biol. 2014 Feb 3;24(3):322-8.   
There you can find quite detailed description of theory and numerical realization behind it.

But actually it is pretty general and can be applied to any other thin rod (macroscopic too).
